# Hi, I'm Kamil

**Tech Lead DevOps** · 11 years in IT, 6+ in DevOps, 3+ leading teams

I help teams ship reliably, automate the boring stuff, and keep production from catching fire. When it does — I'm the one writing the postmortem so we don't do it twice.

- Building and leading DevOps teams (up to 5 people)
- Designing infra that scales, survives, and doesn't keep you up at night
- Spreading the "you build it, you run it" vibe and making IaC the default, not the exception
- Based in Kazan, working remotely
